# Zookeeper

This project is a part of the Kotlin Core course provided by Hyperskill. The intent behind this project was to apply practical programming skills in Kotlin by developing a zoo simulation where the zookeeper can manage and interact with different habitats and animals.

## What I Learned

Throughout the development of this project, I've gained a comprehensive understanding of several core programming concepts in Kotlin and applied them in a hands-on manner. Hereâ€™s a summary of the topics I've mastered:

### Stage 1/4: Rush into Print
- Basic Literals: numbers, strings, and characters
- Writing the first program and understanding Kotlin's syntax
- Standard output and invoking functions in Kotlin
- Variables and constants: `val` vs `var`
- Introduction to Kotlin data types and their usage

### Stage 2/4: Show me an Animal!
- Input handling with Java Scanner in a Kotlin program
- Boolean logic and operations
- Understanding objects and their properties in Kotlin
- String manipulation and basics
- Exploring the properties of basic types and units of information in programming

### Stage 3/4: What's Inside?
- Performing arithmetic operations with Kotlin
- Integers in action: Understanding numeric types in Kotlin
- Comparing numbers using relational operators
- Working with binary and hexadecimal numbers
- Type coercion and increment/decrement operations
- Reading data with `readln` and introduction to `MutableList` in Kotlin

### Stage 4/4: Sustainable Care
- Using string templates for dynamic strings
- Implementing if expressions for control flow
- Loops in Kotlin: `while` and `repeat` statements for iteration
